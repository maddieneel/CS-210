# CS-210

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is the first project I did in CS210. This project was used to create two clocks that display simultaneously for both 12 hour and 24 hour time. This program allowed the user to change the time, using the user menu, to the desired time. 

# What did you do particularly well?
While it is nowhere near perfect, it produces the correct time depending on the user input. Furthermore, input validation such as if the user wanted to add an hour when it was already 12:00 (for the 12-hour clock) it would change to 1:00 instead of an incorrect time, 13:00.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
In order to enhance my code, I should have created different classes to minimize the code I had in main(). This would have allowed my code to be easier to follow. Another enhancement I should have used while() statements instead of goto statements.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The part that I found most challenging was simply making sure each clock produced the correct time depending on if it was 12-hour or 24-hour. As Iâ€™m someone who very rarely uses military time, I googled a guide to show both a 12 and 24 hour clock side by side with given times. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
As this was one of our simpler projects, I got a good footing with switch-case statements. As the weeks went on, I used more variations of switch-cases and kept improving on each time to give better results.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
One of the issues I had gotten points taken off for was the lack of comments. If I were to redo this project, I would have explained each section better with comments than I did. I made it readable by using variables that would not make you question what it was for; such as, twelveHourTimeHour, twelveHourTimeMinute, twelveHourTimeSecond, and AmPm.
